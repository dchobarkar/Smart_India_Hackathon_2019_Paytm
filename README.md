### About The Project

A smart app to reduce the amount of push notifications require for e-commorce apps by focusing personalised approach.

#### Problem Statement

Reduce the amount of push notifications require for e-commerce apps

#### Solution

In our approach we have focused on integration of both recommendation system and the right time of the day. We have used Machine Learning to find the ideal time of the day to send the notification to the user. While recommendation system suggests the product, server waits till the right time to send the notification to the user. Time factor is calculated on various factors such as location based data, motion data, call history and SMS.
